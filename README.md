# Happy-Beaver
This is my first game, developed during the "JS games and visualisation" course from Khan Academy. There are some changes there are my personal, like a increasing level (which makes the game more difficult throughout the levels), monster, some bad sticks and a score keeper.

For this game I use some internet images that you can find in Khan Academy. I also use the proccessingJs library. 
This game consists on a 2d interface. The user can only make the character (which is a Beaver by default) jump, this is done by pressing space bar. The objective is to grab as many sticks as possible. 
The game has 4 (four) different screens, a menu, the playing screen, a help page and a game over pager. For more details you can read the help page.

Any sugestions, or bugs please send me a message.

Thx for passing by!
